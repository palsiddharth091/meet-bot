# meet-bot

I have made a meet bot. This bot is basically a class redirector. You open this bot at the beginning of the day and once you have pressed the go button dont close the tab. 
Leave it as it is and as your times is scheduled the bot will open your meet link tabs for you and once all your classes are over for the day the bot will close it self within
10 secs.
